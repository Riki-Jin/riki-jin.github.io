## INTRODUCTION
_A microbiota is an "ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms"[1][2] found in and on all multicellular organisms studied to date from plants to animals. A microbiota includes bacteria, archaea, protists, fungi and viruses. Microbiota have been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of their host. The synonymous term microbiome describes either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that reside in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves._ (Wikipedia)

The microbiome represents all microbial species that are present in a particular environment. Advances in sequencing technology have facilitated the characterization of microbial communities in various environments and the identification of species that would be difficult, if not impossible, to cultivate through traditional methods. 

Alterations in microbiome composition have been linked to numerous health conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and respiratory illnesses (Young 2017). In the context of human health, microbiome studies seek to understand the interaction between host biological and environmental factors and microbiome structure with the future goal of developing methods to treat disease through the modulation of microbial composition (Xia and Sun 2017). One method of assessing microbe-disease associations is through differential abundance testing, which identifies differences in mean abundances of various species between healthy and diseased individuals.

Common sequencing methods used to characterize microbiomes are marker gene surveys and whole genome shotgun sequencing. Marker gene surveys sequence a gene with high sequence variability between species, often the 16S rRNA gene, to identify microbes present within the sample; in contrast, whole genome sequencing does not have such restrictions. Reads with a specified amount of sequence similarity, typically ~97%, are clustered into operation taxonomic units (OTUs), which are representative of species (Jovel et al. 2016). The resulting data are organized into matrices with counts representing the abundance of each OTU in each sample.
	
Microbiome sequencing data is typically sparse with a high percentage of zero counts. Various sources have estimated this value to be approximately between 50-90% of the total sample counts (Weiss et al. 2017). These zeros may indicate true absence of the species in the sample or they may be caused by insufficient sequencing depth, an example of which is a rare species that is approaching the limit of detection by the machine. Additionally, the number of detected species is rarely saturated and further sequencing typically leads to more observed species (Weiss et al. 2017).

In this context, library size is defined as the total counts per sample. Differential sequencing efficiency can result in large differences in library sizes between samples, which can obscure true differences in species abundance. For example, if Sample A has five times the library size as that of Sample B, all of the OTUs in Sample A would appear to be differentially abundant even if the relative abundances between the two groups are similar, due to the fact that the absolute counts in Sample A would much higher. This library size effect can be reduced by using normalization methods, which remove biases and variation introduced by sampling and sequencing processes.

The goal of this study is to compare the performance of common normalization and differential abundance testing methods used for the analysis of microbiome data when sample library sizes are similar versus when they are different. The efficacy of these methods will be evaluated in terms of their type I error rates and power using data simulated from a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Previous studies have used existing microbiome datasets to compare methods in the presence of batch effects, but have not thoroughly addressed the library size issue (McMurdie and Holmes 2014; Pereira et al. 2018; Weiss et al. 2017).
